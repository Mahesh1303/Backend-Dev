moongose have a schema in which we define a structure and using this schema we buld our model
and using this model we do crud operations



eg this was a model 
{
    "first_name": "Mahesh",
    "last_name": "Divate",
    "email": "max@gmail.com",
    "id": 1004
  },
  {
    "first_name": "Mahesh",
    "last_name": "Divate",
    "email": "max@gmail.com",
    "id": 1005}
