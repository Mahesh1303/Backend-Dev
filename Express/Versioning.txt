so 

there Are Versions for every model PResent \

eg 4.15.2



4----->First 
15-----> Second
2------>last 

Versioning is Very imp because a slight change in it can lead to hacking


last part========2---->>> the last Digit signifies the minor Updates in the Version

Second Part=========15------->This means that it is a critical update which is mandatorily required ie they did somee critical bug fix
                                eg they added some functionalities etc

first part===========4-------->THis is the Major Release Update and Breaking Update we should not update it 
                                it can stop working of the preversion made projects so it will break the code





for Version it also mentions 

^4.18.2

this     ^   symbol means dont change that first number but you can change other
            eg   4.12.4        , 4.21.1 etcccccc so this Specifies that when we update using npm the first digit 4 will not change

            eg ^4.18.2
                npm update

                then it will get next ^4.21.1 etcc
